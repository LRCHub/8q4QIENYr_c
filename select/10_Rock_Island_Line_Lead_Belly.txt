Oh that Rock Island Line is a mighty good road,
Oh that Rock Island Line is that road to ride,
Oh that Rock Island Line is a mighty good road,

If you want to ride, you got to ride it like you find it,
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line.
Jesus died to save our sins--hooray to God,
We're going to meet him again!

I may be right and I may be wrong,
You are going to miss me when I'm gone!

A, B, C, W, X, Y and Z
Cats in the cupboard, but they don't see me!
